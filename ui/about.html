        <h2 style=font-sizes:20px;s>What is linksites?</h2>
            <p style=font-size:20px;margin-left:124px;>It is a site through which anyone can link to various sites which are useful in their daily needs.It just makes it easy that all the daily required sites are available. </p>
            <h3 style=font-size:20px;>About Myself</h3>
            <p>I am Karthik Raman,an enginnering student.This is my first web app.My main moto for developing this app was,instead of searching sites in google by openning this application,I can access all the sites which I want with ease.</p>
            <h4 style=font-size:20px;>My Journey of linksites</h4>
            <p>At First I had no intention of developing a web application.In the beginning of my semester I came to know of a computer course which was teaching me an introduction towards modern web application.I took that course as a initiative and finally got interest towards web application development.I finished my course and atlast I had a project to submit one web application.</p>
            <p>My First doubt was where to begin my website with and what to do? I consulted many of my friends and relatives but I didnt find any appropriate solution.Then I tried searching in Google for any projects which I could implement but still that did'nt work out.Then I thought for a while that Google helps us to search different websites.I thought for a while that why dont I create a wbsite which instead of searching will give the list of websites that we use daily in our day to day life.atleast it will reduce time for searching.Then I thought to give it a name as <b>linksites</b> as it links various websites from one website.</p>
            <p>As I got the idea of what to implement,Now my next problem is how to implement?Each day and night I kept thinking about it!I used to create something and erase it again and I kept it repeating as I did'nt feel satisfied.Then somehow I got the idea of,making several buttons of different categories which will lead to its respective sites and further with help of Google and other websites,I somehow managed to implement it.As it was my experience towards a modern web application development,it was a good experience for me,I faced many difficulties and I learned a lot from that course and now I gained interest towards web designing.</p>
            <p>I also thought for implementing this in another manner which is more useful.I thought that first I would create an user login page which after login in would copy-paste their respective user's id password in the any website present in linksites.As I lack in the knowledge of security issues,I could'nt implement it over my website.But I will further implement it and I will keep updating my web application and I will make it more useful for the user.</p>
            <p>I am trying my best to make my website more useful and interesting.You can also help me by sharing your ideas,helping me improving my website.</p>
