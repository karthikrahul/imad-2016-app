            <h1>GENIUS PERSONALIIES IN OUR WORLD</h1>
            <P1><strong>Albert Einstein,Madam Curie,Thomas Alva Edison,Nikola Tesla</strong> etc and we can think of many more geniuses present in our world. </P1></div>
            <h2>What made us say that these personalities are Genius Brain's?</h2>
            <p2>Each of these individuals has contributed something to our society.But what makes a genius?Are the brains of these individuals different from "normal" prople?</p2>
            <h3>Differences between Genius Brain and Normal Brain</h3>
            <p3>Cortex
            <li>A genius's brain is heavily biased towards long or short connections.Short connections indicate an aptitude in one interest,while long connections suggest aptitude in many interests and the ability to see problems from new perspectives.</li>
            <li>The average brain has long and short connections between the various brain regions,with a slight bias either way that varies from person to person.</li></p3>
            <p4>Dopamine Receptors
            <li>The thalamus is the brain's relay centre.Information from the brain's sensory parts bottleneck at the thalamus,where they're filtered and sent to the cortex</li></p4>
            <p5>Grey Matter
            <li>Grey Matter refers to the darker tissue of the brain and spinal cord.It is made up of dendrites,branching out,literally waiting to receive information from axons.When studying the brains of those who acheived high IQ scores,in this case,over 130,grater volumes of grey matter were discovered.In addition,the white matter of the brain,where the axons live,was also more abundant.Recently published pictures of the brain of Albert Einstein had not only a thicker and greater amount of grey matter,but also more intricate folds throughout the gray matter,suggesting that this may also be a factor identifying the genius brain.</li></p5>
            <h4>Way of Approach</h4>
            <p6>Normal Brain's:Consider how normal brain approach a particular problem.Perhapshe start with a flood of ideas.Then,most likely he start eliminating these ideas.One won't work because he might have run out of money.Another won't work becausehe might have tried it before and failed .Yet another can't possibly work because no one will be on board with it.Finally he may find some ideas and come up with one or two that might work.</p6>
            <p7>Genius Brain:The genius brain works differently.Ideas are not eliminate based on efficacy or practicality.Everything is considered.THoughts are not immediately disqualified.A genius often tries many different avenues to arrive at a desired result,rather than simply deciding which ones will work and which ones won't.</p7>
